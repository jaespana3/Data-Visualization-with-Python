# Coursera Course Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the Coursera Course Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis applies skills in data cleaning, querying, and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

## Dataset

* **Source:** Coursera Course Dataset (Kaggle)
* **Contents:** Information related to various Coursera courses, including metadata and course features.

## Analysis Objectives

* Load and clean the dataset by addressing missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
* Perform exploratory data analysis to investigate key aspects of the dataset.
* Create visualizations to better understand trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.
* Document clear explanations throughout the notebook describing the aims, methods, and outcomes of each analysis step.
* Suggest possible improvements or extensions for the analysis approach.
